🧩 Likely Microsoft LLD Question (Reconstructed)
📌 Problem Theme

Design an Organization Hierarchy System

Where:

Employees belong to a hierarchical organization

Each employee has at most one manager

A manager can have multiple direct reports

🔥 The Twist (Important)

If a manager is removed,
all employees under that manager should be re-assigned correctly.

This is the key difficulty.

📌 Typical Problem Statement (Microsoft-style)

Design a system to represent an organization hierarchy.

Each employee has:

employeeId

name

managerId (null for CEO)

The system should support:

Add employee

Remove employee

Get manager of an employee

Get all subordinates of an employee

If a manager is removed, all direct reports should be re-assigned to the removed manager’s manager

🧠 Example (THIS is what interviewer usually gives)
Initial hierarchy
CEO
 └── A
     ├── B
     │   ├── D
     │   └── E
     └── C

Remove manager A

Result:

CEO
 ├── B
 │   ├── D
 │   └── E
 └── C


👉 B and C now report directly to CEO
