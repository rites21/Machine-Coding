✈️ Flight Booking System — PRACTICE SETUP
⏱️ Total Time: 90 minutes

You should consciously manage time like this:

Phase	Time
Clarify requirements	10 min
Identify entities & APIs	15 min
Core data structures	15 min
Route algorithms	25 min
CLI handling + demo	15 min
Buffer / refactor	10 min
📌 Functional Requirements (STRICT)
1️⃣ Flight Registration

Airlines can register direct flights

A flight has:

Airline name

Source city

Destination city

Price

Optional features (e.g., hasMeal)

(Optional later) departure/arrival time

Input format (CLI-style)
register AirlineName SourceCity DestinationCity Price [hasMeal]

Output
AirlineName SourceCity -> DestinationCity flight registered

2️⃣ Flight Search

Customers can search routes between two cities.

Input format
search SourceCity DestinationCity [hasMeal]

Output must contain exactly TWO routes (if available):
✈️ Route with Minimum Number of Hops

Minimize number of flights

If multiple exist, return any one

Cost is secondary (ignored unless needed for output)

💸 Route with Lowest Total Cost

Minimize total price

Number of hops is secondary

✅ Filters

If hasMeal=true is passed:

All flights in the route must support meals

Filter applies to both results

🧠 Algorithmic Requirements (IMPORTANT)

Flights form a directed graph

Cities are nodes

Flights are edges

Graph is in-memory only

You must support:

Graph traversal

Different optimization criteria:

Min hops

Min cost

🚫 Explicit Constraints

❌ No database

❌ No frameworks (Spring, Lombok, etc.)

❌ No external libraries for graphs

❌ No internet

❌ No UI

✅ Plain Java / in-memory objects only

🧱 Non-Functional Requirements

Code must be:

Modular

Readable

Extensible

Should be demoable via CLI inputs

Should handle:

No route found

Source = destination

Cycles in graph

Multiple airlines on same route

🔍 Edge Cases You MUST Think About

Do NOT code yet, but be ready to handle:

No path exists

Multiple flights between same cities

Cyclic routes (e.g., DEL → BLR → DEL)

Filter eliminates all paths

Source or destination not registered

Same city appearing multiple times in path (avoid infinite loops)

🧩 Out of Scope (DO NOT IMPLEMENT unless asked)

Seat availability

Booking / payment

User accounts

Persistence

Cancellation

Dynamic pricing

🧪 Sample Commands (for your own testing)
register JetAir DEL BLR 500 true
register JetAir BLR LON 1000 true
register Delta DEL LON 2000 true
register Delta LON NYC 2000 true

search DEL NYC
search DEL NYC true

🎯 Interviewer Expectations (READ CAREFULLY)

They will judge you on:

Requirement clarity (did you ask/assume correctly?)

Entity modeling (Flight, Route, Graph, etc.)

Algorithm choice (BFS vs Dijkstra — but don’t jump early)

Separation of concerns

How you explain tradeoffs

❗ VERY IMPORTANT RULE FOR THIS PRACTICE

👉 Do NOT over-engineer

No patterns for the sake of patterns

No premature optimization

Keep it simple and correct
